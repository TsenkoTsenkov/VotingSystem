# VotingSystem

This is the repository for the decentralized voting system that I am building for my diploma.
Which I actually failed miserably :(
But now I will start once again   :)

    The first step now is to recreate the how backend in C++. 
This could help me in the uni since now we are learning about OOP
and this problem is good enough for practicing OOP in C++.
And the idea will become more clear to undersand and more easy
to implement in the more complicated blockchain system.
The fronted will have to come too. Web3 and all that shit is going to be
lelearn again. Vue too. But who cares. I want to do it better.
